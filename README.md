# PyARENA

Procedural maps for first-person shooters, written in Python. 

## Installation

`git clone` or download this repository and run `poetry shell`, then `python src/main.py`). Poetry is available from pip, as well as most other package managers.

## Usage
`main.py [-h] width height`

Arguments: the width and height of the map. Using `-h` shows the help message.

It's not really useful to anyone other than me at this time. I might expand it later.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. The "tests" are currently just a file in `src/`.
